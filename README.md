# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing social media reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from textual data, classify sentiments, and visualize patterns in customer feedback.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Loading

Loaded the social media reviews dataset using Pandas.
Conducted initial exploration to examine the structure, distribution, and contents of the dataset.

Preprocessed the text data by handling missing values, removing stop words, special characters, and punctuations.
Performed tokenization, lemmatization, and lowercasing to standardize the text.
Applied techniques to remove noise and irrelevant data, ensuring clean input for sentiment analysis.
### 3. Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

Utilized NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on social media reviews.
Employed libraries such as NLTK and TextBlob for text classification.
Classified reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
Visualized sentiment distribution to identify trends in user feedback.
### 4. Visualization

Created bar charts, word clouds, and pie charts to visualize sentiment distribution and frequently occurring words.
Analyzed the most common words in positive and negative reviews to derive actionable insights.
